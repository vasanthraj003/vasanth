It offers new features that provide not only rich media support but also enhance support for creating web applications that can interact with users, their local data, and servers more easily and effectively than was previously possible.As can be seen in the HTML tag example above, there are not many components. Most HTML tags have an opening tag containing the tag name, tag attributes, a closing tag containing a forward slash, and the tag name being closed. For tags that do not have a closing tag like <img>, it is best practice to end the tag with a forward slash.Most tags are contained in a less than and greater than angle brackets, and everything between the open and close tag is displayed or affected by the tag. In the example above, the <a> tag is creating a link called 'Computer Hope' that is pointing to the hope.html file.</i>");

CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4</i>");

JavaScript is used mainly for enhancing the interaction of a user with the webpage. In other words, you can make your webpage more lively and interactive, with the help of JavaScript. JavaScript is also being used widely in game development and Mobile application development.Modern JavaScript is a “safe” programming language. It does not provide low-level access to memory or CPU, because it was initially created for browsers which do not require it.JavaScript’s capabilities greatly depend on the environment it’s running in. For instance, Node.js supports functions that allow JavaScript to read/write arbitrary files, perform network requests, etc.In-browser JavaScript can do everything related to webpage manipulation, interaction with the user, and the webserver.</i>");
